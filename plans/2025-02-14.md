# Plan - 2025-02-14

## Problem Understanding
- Expand the facility marketing showcase by adding two fully responsive website variants with clearly different structures and color palettes compared to variants 1-4.
- Maintain German tone of voice, reuse shared JS utilities where practical, and keep each variant self-contained (HTML/CSS/JS in its folder) for easy previewing.

## Research Notes
- MDN CSS Grid Layout (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) -- confirms grid/auto-fit patterns are ideal for staggered cards and split layouts used in both new variants.
- W3C WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidance (https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#visual-contrast) -- keep body text contrast >= 4.5:1 when selecting the cyan/amber and terracotta/sage palettes.
- HubSpot Landing Page Design Guide (https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/landing-page-design) -- stresses clear hierarchy, scannable sections, and bold CTAs above the fold; informs hero + CTA placement for both variants.

## Proposed Variants
### Variant 5 -- "Industrial Contrast"
- Color palette: charcoal (#0f1b2c), electric cyan (#00d4ff), warm amber accents (#ffb347); glassmorphism card surfaces.
- Layout: split hero with animated metrics column, diagonal section dividers, CSS Grid-powered service matrix, vertical timeline for process.
- Interaction: sticky progress sidebar on desktop, smooth scroll/highlight, subtle parallax background textures.

### Variant 6 -- "Organic Terracotta"
- Palette: desert terracotta (#c2561a), sand (#f4e3c3), sage (#6d9773), deep forest (#1f3b2c) for text.
- Layout: magazine-style editorial flow with alternating full-bleed imagery bands, curved section separators, testimonials carousel, stacked accordions for service packages.
- Interaction: scroll-triggered fade/slide animations, accentuated buttons with layered shadows, responsive cards that collapse to accordions on mobile.

## Asset Inventory & Wireframe Notes
### Shared Assets
- `scroll-animations.js` (IntersectionObserver-based) already lives in each variant folder; copy as-is to reuse animation hooks.
- Variant `script.js` files initialize navigation, smooth scrolling, and light UI widgets -- new variants will follow suit with bespoke logic.
- Remote Unsplash imagery is referenced directly, so no additional asset pipeline needs to be introduced.

### Variant 5 -- Section Blueprint
1. Header + Sticky Progress Aside: Transparent hero header plus a desktop-only sticky aside that highlights the current section via IntersectionObserver.
2. Split Hero: Left column with hero copy/CTAs, right column with stacked metric cards on a gradient glass panel.
3. Signal Grid: 2x3 CSS Grid matrix where each card shows a capability icon, title, and microcopy.
4. Operations Board: Horizontal scrolling tech/certification cards with glow borders.
5. Process Timeline: Vertical line with numbered steps and expandable details.
6. Contact / CTA Panel: Full-width dark panel hosting a compact form, trust badges, and gradient CTA.

### Variant 6 -- Section Blueprint
1. Curved Hero: Organic blob background, layered headline (Playfair + Source Sans 3), dual CTAs, and curved metric chips.
2. Story Section: Alternating text/image columns with rounded cards and soft drop shadows.
3. Experience Gallery: Full-bleed image strips stacked with overlapping descriptive cards.
4. Service Packages Accordion: Three accordions (Basis, Signature, Bespoke) with expand/collapse behavior.
5. Testimonials Carousel: Simple slider cycling through quotes with dot navigation plus prev/next controls.
6. Contact Oasis: Rounded container with form fields, location info, and decorative leaf illustration.

## To-Do List
1. [x] Catalogue reusable assets (fonts, JS helpers, animation utilities) and decide what to copy into each new variant.
2. [x] Define detailed section-by-section wireframes plus typography choices for Variant 5 based on the research insights.
3. [x] Scaffold `variant5/` (HTML, CSS, JS) and build the structural markup following the wireframe.
4. [x] Implement Variant 5 styling/interaction: grid layouts, split hero, sticky sidebar, color palette, and responsiveness.
5. [x] Define the editorial flow for Variant 6 (section order, imagery treatments, component behavior).
6. [x] Scaffold `variant6/` and implement markup for all sections, ensuring a distinct structure from earlier variants.
7. [x] Implement Variant 6 styles/interactions: organic palette, curved separators, testimonials carousel behavior, responsive accordions.
8. [x] Update the root `index.html` (and any related overview assets) to showcase the two new variants with descriptions and feature lists.
9. [x] Run sanity checks (HTML validation via browser/linters if possible, basic spell/contrast review) and document verification steps for the user.
